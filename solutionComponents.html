<P>
    The software is highly modular in nature with each component capable of operating independently.
    The four main sections mentioned in the summary is still present but with a lot more detail.

<h2>Document Library</h2>
<P>
    The library contains a public and a private area with the hospital in control of what information can be shared.
    If we consider manuals relating to devices then sharing that with other NHS organisations make sense and this
    will reduce the amount of time collecting and indexing device documentation. By combining all documentation it
    enables us to use AI to enhance the information and provide services such as Help and Support.
</P>
<P>
    A major differentiator is the help/support section. With recent advances, the traditional methods such as: press 1, 2, 4 and star to get to the FAQ.
    can be replaced with something much more intuitive like chat_GPT and other software advances. This can also be
    brought into other flows. Consider the following:
    <P>
    Several people have estimated the number of false "equipment is broken" requests is at 70% of the total. This wastes
    time for all parties involved from the ward through to engineering. The ward staff are very busy and so cannot spent
    minutes trying to diagnose the problem. However, suppose they get one question to answer when filling in the form.
    An obvious example is "can you confirm the light in the picture is on and showing green" which might lead to can
    you check power ...
    </P>
</P>
<P>Identity is important with a number of different techniques used ranging from simple stickers to RFID and other systems.
    We are planning to provide interfaces to the common products in use and provide a cross reference which can be used
    to enhance reporting. In addition, a public interface will be provides which will allow anybody to scan a QR code
    and receive limited information about the device. This could be used to return equipment or certify its status
    when it is placed on the second hand market to increase resale value.
</P>
<P>
    Workflows are critical from a regulatory and operational basis. This can take a considerable number of days
    effort by a team of people to create, validate and approve. They are also continually reviewed.
    In addition to the sharing aspect we are planning on producing pro-forma workflows directly from the documentation
    library which are intended to be more comprehensive and reduce reviewer time.

    Want to talk about PPM, Location, Usage, Virtual wards, Software as a medical device.
