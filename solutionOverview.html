<P>
    Our solution brings together the management of all physical and software based medical devices to improve
    the effectiveness and efficiency to provide greater visibility for data governance and help manage cyber risk.
</P>
<P>
    Facilitating greater collaboration between teams that have remained siloed to date
    is a key element of our solution.
</P>
<P>
    Hospitals are facing increasing challenges in the management of digital health technologies
</P>
<P>
With connectivity for med devices came great opportunities for improved patient safety,
    outcomes and efficiencies yet it has caused heightened complexity in the management of hospital networks,
    increased risk from cyber security incidents and data breaches and added complexity with
    compatibility and the management of patching, updates and maintenance requirements
</P>
<P>
    Cyber risk coupled with the proliferation of SaMD and AIaMD have brought about an
    overhaul of the regulatory framework adding additional administrative burden to overstretched hospitals
</P>

<P>Siloes: previously one team dealing with devices, now the responsibility lies with various siloed teams
    that have not traditionally worked together</P>
