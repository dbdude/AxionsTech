            Designed, from scratch, to cater the needs of the entire clinical infrastructure and built to comply with
            proposed new standards. Delivery is in the form of components which are capable of
            running individually or combined to provide more functionality as needed.
        </p>
        <P>
            There are some key design elements of our proposal. We are intending to address all
            requirements of medical science teams from acquisition, usage through to disposal.
            Most of these requirements have come directly from medical science teams.
            We are now ready to proceed to the build phase in collaboration with a number of
            hospital partners.

        <P>
            Recent advances in ML/AI can be leveraged to assist in the medical device world. This will
            provide significant benefit. It is important that we are proposing some novel implementations and not
            shoehorning an existing 'round' solution into a clinical 'square' hole.
            One example is we intend to semi-automate device failure reporting. If we just added a chat-bot it is
            likely that it will not be used because the ward staff cannot spare the time. Asking a single question
            however could reduce false reports and not be onerous on the ward team.
