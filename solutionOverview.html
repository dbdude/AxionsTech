            We are building a series of modular packages aimed at managing all aspects of medical devices from
            commisioning, lifecycle and disposal.

            Software and Communications are becoming more endemic driving future legistation changes and
            increasing complexity. Managing this will require intelligence within the software.

            AxionsTech are producing the software, from scratch, in order to cater
            for the needs of the entire clinical device ecosystem. </P>
        <P>
            The solution is intended to address all of the
            requirements of medical science teams from acquisition, usage through to disposal.
            Most of these requirements have come directly from medical science teams and other hospital teams
            including management.
            We are now ready to proceed to the build phase in collaboration with a number of
            hospital partners.

            Delivery is in the form of components which are capable of
            running individually or combined to provide more functionality as needed. Client data
            is segregated to ensure data privacy.
        </p>
        <P>
            This is a
            new development it is built to comply with
            proposed new standards such as Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) which introduces
            significant complexity on the medical engineering teams.
        </P>
        <P>
            Recent advances in ML/AI can be leveraged to assist in the medical device world which is a key
            differentiator. This will provide significant benefit by supporting the medical science team.
            It is important to note that we are proposing some novel implementations and not
            shoehorning an existing 'round' solution into a clinical 'square' hole.
            One example is we intend to semi-automate device failure reporting. If we just added a chat-bot it is
            likely that it will not be used because the ward staff cannot spare the time. Asking a single question
            however could reduce false reports and not be onerous on the ward team.

            The software is designed to allow you to manage and optimize assets throughout their lifecycle.
            Compliance and Maintenance is clearly an important aspect. This can allow you to
            reduce costs, mitigate risks, and improve overall software asset utilisation.
        </P>
        <P>
            The increase in usage for software as a device and virtual wards means software assets used within the organization
            are increasingly important.
            This includes commercially purchased software and internally developed applications, applications,
            licenses, versions, and installations.
            License management including complience becomes more complex.
        </P>
        <P>
            Tracking and usage are equally important. This may be obtained directly or from integrations to other
            software products such as RfiD solutions or network sensors. Even in this is not available it is possible
            to get information from other systems such as DNS service, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or
            observing activity via stored data and images.

            Vendor Management: Maintain relationships with software vendors and stay informed about licensing changes,
            updates, and new versions. Regularly communicate with vendors to address any licensing concerns, obtain support,
            and explore cost-saving opportunities.
        </P>
        <P>
            Software Deployment and Installation: Implement standardized procedures for deploying and installing
            software across the organization. This helps ensure consistency, minimize unauthorized installations, and
            streamline the software management process.
        </P>
        <P>
            Risk Management: Identify and mitigate risks associated with software assets, such as security
            vulnerabilities, end-of-life software versions, and non-compliance. Regularly update software to address
            security patches and vulnerabilities.
        </P>
        <P>
            Training and Awareness: Provide training and awareness programs to educate employees about software
            asset management policies, procedures, and best practices. Promote a culture of compliance and responsible
            software usage within the organization.
        </P>
        <P>
            Reporting and Auditing: Generate reports and conduct periodic audits to assess software asset
            management effectiveness, identify areas for improvement, and demonstrate compliance to stakeholders,
            software publishers, or regulatory bodies.

            The analysis and reporting components will be capable of providing dashboards and reports on all aspects of
            the system including elements such as: effectiveness of the current PPM schedules from a safety and

            A key element is the storage of all associated documentation and processes. From a regulation
            perspective some of this information is already captured and, typically, stored on local file servers.
            We are intended to provide an alternative, elements of which which can be shared between trusts.

        <p>
            Proposed regulations such as storing, and keeping up to date, software bills of materials (SBOM)
            will greatly increase the complexity of trying to manage this manually.

            Asset identification and classification allows multiple id's to be cross referenced to a single device.
            This device is classified using multiple ontologies to allow a common definition to be used depending
            upon the user. If the device has an AxionsTech QR code then scanning it can provide information to
            3rd parties as permitted. Two examples would be a device moving between locations, the destination can
            scan the QR code to let the owning hospital know they have the device. A second usage might be
            providing a passport for devices released to the resale marketplace. The amount of information provided
            depends upon that permitted.
