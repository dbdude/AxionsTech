<P>
    Hospitals are facing increasing challenges in the management of digital health technologies.
    The explosion of smart Medical Devices has brought great opportunities to improve patient care and outcomes.
    With connectivity for med devices came great opportunities for improved patient safety,
    outcomes and efficiencies yet it has caused heightened complexity in the management of hospital networks,
    increased risk from cyber security incidents and data breaches and added complexity with
    compatibility and the management of patching, updates and maintenance requirements
</P>
<P>
    Engineering teams have to adapt to these new environments which is bringing fresh demands upon skills and
    processes. It also increases the complexity of any associated diagnostics as well as the number of possible
    failure points. Consider a device no longer logging data into a patient monitoring system, the network now
    becomes a possible candidate for the issue.
</P>

<P>
    Our solution brings together the management of all aspects of physical and software based medical devices to improve
    the effectiveness and efficiency to provide greater visibility for data governance and help manage cyber risk.
</P>
<P>The "Document Library" is a key enabler. Keeping all the relevent documentation in one place provides a
    corpus of knowledge for AI algorithms to operate over.
    When this is combined with maintenance information and usage it becomes even more valuable. It is proposed to
    offer elements of this component to wider audiences in order to crowd source new material.
</P>
<P>
    Facilitating greater collaboration between teams that have remained siloed to date is a key element of our solution.
</P>
<P>
    Cyber risk coupled with the proliferation of SaMD and AIaMD have brought about an
    overhaul of the regulatory framework adding additional administrative burden to overstretched hospitals
</P>

<P>
    Planned preventative maintenance (PPM) needs to be effectively scheduled and continually evaluated.
    Knowledge discovery techniques need to constantly monitor equipment and adjust schedules as needed in order
    to prevent failures.
</P>
