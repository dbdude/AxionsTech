            Designed, from scratch, to cater the needs of the entire clinical infrastructure and built to comply with
            proposed new standards. Delivery is in the form of components which are capable of
            running individually or combined to provide more functionality as needed.
        </p>
        <P>
            There are some key design elements of our proposal. We are intending to address all
            requirements of medical science teams from acquisition, usage through to disposal.
            Most of these requirements have come directly from medical science teams.
            We are now ready to proceed to the build phase in collaboration with a number of
            hospital partners.
        </P>
        <P>
            Recent advances in ML/AI can be leveraged to assist in the medical device world. This will
            provide significant benefit. It is important that we are proposing some novel implementations and not
            shoehorning an existing 'round' solution into a clinical 'square' hole.
            One example is we intend to semi-automate device failure reporting. If we just added a chat-bot it is
            likely that it will not be used because the ward staff cannot spare the time. Asking a single question
            however could reduce false reports and not be onerous on the ward team.

        Regulatory reporting now and proposed are part of the standard package in order to ease the burden of reporting
        and ensure complience. In addition, addition elements such as device
        standardisation, identification and tracking will be available.

            The need for for a Medical devices solution within the Health sector become very obvious whilst working within the NHS on an IoT cyber

            The analysis and reporting components will be capable of providing dashboards and reports on all aspects of
            the system including elements such as: effectiveness of the current PPM schedules from a safety and
            efficiency perspective.

        <p>
            A key element is the storage of all associated documentation and processes. From a regulation
            perspective some of this information is already captured and, typically, stored on local file servers.
            We are intended to provide an alternative, elements of which which can be shared between trusts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Proposed regulations such as storing, and keeping up to date, software bills of materials (SBOM)
            will greatly increase the complexity of trying to manage this manually.
