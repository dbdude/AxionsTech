Hospitals are facing increasing challenges in the management of digital health technologies
</P>
<P>
With connectivity for med devices came great opportunities for improved patient safety,
    outcomes and efficiencies yet it has caused heightened complexity in the management of hospital networks,
    increased risk from cyber security incidents and data breaches and added complexity with
    compatibility and the management of patching, updates and maintenance requirements
</P>
<P>Cyber risk coupled with the proliferation of SaMD and AIaMD have brought about an
    overhaul of the regulatory framework adding additional administrative burden to overstretched hospitals
