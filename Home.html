            Delivery of patient care has been enhanced by connecting medical devices.
            However, increased connectivity puts strain on hospital networks, which
            are often blighted by legacy infrastructure. Cyber risk and
            complexity are increased unless software is kept up-to-date and components are compatible.

        <P>
            Increased cyber risk, coupled with the proliferation of software and AI have brought about
            imminent changes to the regulatory framework for medical devices.
            Hospitals will need to adapt their existing practices as well as
            manage the priorities from IT/network and governance teams that now also have a stake in the management of device safety.

        <P>
            Once upon a time, we had patients, clinical teams, medical devices with dedicated medical engineers to manage them.
            <BR>In today's connected world, medical teams access patient data in the cloud.
            Virtual wards, software and AI as a
            medical device have to be integrated alongside their supply chain.
            In order for data to move through the network and deliver timely results,
            multiple teams and data silos are now involved; all critical to patient care.
            This linkage requires effective communication which, in itself, introduces its own set of challenges.

            Facilitating greater collaboration between teams that have remained siloed to date
            is a key element of our solution.
