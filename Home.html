        <P>
            Increasingly connected Devices are facilitating opportunities for improved patient safety,
            outcomes and efficiencies. This has created increased demands on hospital networks which are often frustrated by
            legacy infrastruture. The variety of software
            components they use needs additional consideration for compatibility and updating.
        </P>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-2">
        <P>Regulation</P>
        <P>
            Current regulations have, rightly, been focused around process, auditability and physical device safety.
            The introduction of newer technologies have meant this scope has widened to software (IT?) and connectivity (Networks).
            Each of these have their own policies and regulations.
        </P>
        <P>
            The combination of Cyber risk coupled with the proliferation of SaMD and AIaMD have brought about an
            overhaul of the regulatory framework. These newer regulations are in the consultation process and hospitals
            need to adapt quickly adding to overstretched resourcres.

    <div class="grid-item-3">
        <P>Complexity and Silos</P>
        <P>
            Traditionally, A medical device is next to the patient displaying data directly to the clinician.
            In today's connected world, this is far more complex. Patient systems existing in the cloud need to be
            reached; Virtual wards need to be integrated; Software as a Medical device is becoming more common needing
            supply chain management. The introduction of Virtual wards extracts these concepts even further.
        </P>

        <P>
            Multiple teams and multiple data silos are now involved; all critical to patient care.
            This linkage requires effective communications which introduces its own challenges.

            Our solution is build from scratch with the needs of Medical Devices now and in the near future in mind.

        </P>

        <P>
            Facilitating greater collaboration between teams that have remained siloed to date
            is a key element of our solution.

        <P>Siloes: previously one team dealing with devices, now the responsibility lies with various siloed teams
            that have not traditionally worked together</P>
